MusicManager2 v2

By Mikael Eiman <mikael@eiman.tv>

What it is

One day I got tired of looking for my MP3:s, so I wrote a little
app that queried for them and presented them in a nice list,
grouped by artist and album.

Requirements

* SoundPlay, a registered one if possible
* Indexed Audio:Title and Audio:Artist attributes on the files
you want to see in the list.

Instructions

Getting started

First of all, the best way to run this is with a SoundPlay replicant
embedded in your Desktop. Have a peek at the screenshot and
you'll know what I mean.

Run MusicManager2. It will now query for your music files
and present them in a list. You will also get a playlist window.

Drag and drop artists, albums or songs from the Tracks window
to the Playlist window.

Press Start in the Playlist window.

The playlist will first select the top song in the upper list, start
playing it and remove it from the list. If there are no songs in
the upper list, a song is randomly selected from the bottom
list (and it's not removed).

Playlist manipulation

You can remove files from the Playlist by selecting them and
pressing you secondary mouse button. You'll get a little menu
with the options Remove and Crop. Remove does what you'd
expect, and Crop removes all files NOT selected.

You can also save and load playlists. It is the list of random
songs that is saved/loaded.
